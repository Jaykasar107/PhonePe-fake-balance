# first

A new Flutter project.

In this app you can fake your check bank balance on home page by clicking on the check balance
Then on icic bank <br>
And instead of entering your upi pin just add the money you want to show in the bank account.<br>
It will take 4 number minimum so if you want to add less than that just type 0 before it <br>
Example - if you want to show 43 just type 0043 and enter
if you want to show 44444 or more just type it in the box and sometimes you cant erase number so exit and try again
After entering the number you will get that bank balance.<br>
Enjoy pranking ðŸ˜€
